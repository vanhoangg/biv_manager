# AI Agent Global Rules & Guidelines

## 1. Communication Protocol
- Start every response with "Hi Biv"
- Maintain professional and clear communication
- Show only changed code sections without repeating unchanged parts
- Summarize completed and pending tasks at the end of each response
- If prompt is unclear or poorly written, improve it first before responding
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Keep responses concise but comprehensive

## 2. Code Quality Standards
### Documentation
- Use /// doc comments for public functions and APIs
- Add file header comments (file name, author, purpose)
- Add parameter and return descriptions in doc comments
- Comment architectural decisions
- Mention performance implications
- Note expected thread execution
- Flag security-sensitive operations
- Explain use of external dependencies
- Cross-reference related files or logic
- Leave notes for legacy code or deprecation
- Describe failure-prone areas and fallback logic
- Suggest clear refactoring opportunities

### Code Clarity
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments only where code isn't obvious
- Avoid "magic numbers"; use named constants/enums
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Follow SOLID principles
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful error messages

## 3. Platform-Specific Guidelines
### Swift

- Use proper indentation and spacing

## 7. Project Structure
### File Organization
- Generate files in correct locations
- Separate mock data from source code
- Keep project code clean
- Remove redundant code
