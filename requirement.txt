Build a responsive Flutter mobile application to manage personal or small business debts. The system should include:

Authentication using Firebase Auth (email, phone, or Google login).

A Dashboard screen that displays total debt, total paid, and remaining debt, along with a chart showing debt changes over time.

A Customer List screen with search and filter capabilities.

A Customer Detail screen that shows all transaction history with the ability to add new debts or payments.

Transaction forms to log new debts or payments with date, note, and image attachment.

A Report screen to export filtered data to PDF or Excel.

Support for REST API integration (backend built in Rust) using Dio + Retrofit.

Smooth, modern UI/UX with responsive design adapting to different screen sizes.

🌟 Additional Smart Features
Advanced Search & Filters: Filter by date range, amount, and payment status (paid/unpaid). Includes real-time name suggestions (autocomplete) when typing customer names.

Attach Image/Bill to Transactions: Allow users to take or upload images (e.g., receipts) when logging a debt or payment.

Voice Notes to Text: Users can record voice memos as notes for each transaction; automatically transcribed and stored as text.

Analytical Reports:

Chart of top 5 customers with highest debt.

Monthly recovery rate analysis.

Debt summary grouped by location or customer category.

### **Use Case 1: User Authentication**

**As a user**
**Given** I am on the authentication screen
**When** I choose to log in via email, phone, or Google
**Then** I should be authenticated using Firebase Auth
**And** be redirected to the Dashboard screen

---

### **Use Case 2: View Dashboard**

**As a user**
**Given** I have logged into the app
**When** I land on the Dashboard screen
**Then** I should see:

* The total debt amount
* The total amount paid
* The remaining debt
* A chart visualizing debt changes over time

---

### **Use Case 3: Browse Customers**

**As a user**
**Given** I am on the Customer List screen
**When** I scroll through or type into the search bar
**Then** I should see a list of customers that match the query
**And** I can apply filters by name, amount, status, or date

---

### **Use Case 4: View Customer Details**

**As a user**
**Given** I tap on a customer from the list
**Then** I should be taken to the Customer Detail screen
**And** I should see:

* All debt and payment transactions associated with that customer
* The ability to add a new debt or payment transaction

---

### **Use Case 5: Add Transaction**

**As a user**
**Given** I am on the Add Transaction screen
**When** I fill in the date, amount, note, and optionally attach an image
**And** optionally record a voice note
**Then** the transaction should be saved and added to the customer's history

---

### **Use Case 6: Attach Image/Bill**

**As a user**
**Given** I am adding or editing a transaction
**When** I choose to upload or take a photo
**Then** the image should be attached to the transaction record

---

### **Use Case 7: Record and Transcribe Voice Note**

**As a user**
**Given** I am adding a transaction
**When** I record a voice memo
**Then** it should be automatically transcribed to text
**And** stored in the transaction notes

---

### **Use Case 8: Generate and Export Reports**

**As a user**
**Given** I am on the Reports screen
**When** I apply filters like date range, customer, location, or status
**Then** I should be able to export the filtered data to PDF or Excel

---

### **Use Case 9: View Analytical Reports**

**As a user**
**Given** I am on the Reports screen
**Then** I should see:

* A chart showing the top 5 customers with the highest debts
* Monthly debt recovery rates
* Summary of debts grouped by location or customer type

---

### **Use Case 10: API Integration**

**As a developer**
**Given** I am implementing data flow in the app
**Then** the app should fetch and send data using Dio and Retrofit
**And** connect seamlessly to a backend written in Rust

---

### **Use Case 11: Responsive UI**

**As a user**
**Given** I use the app on different devices (phone/tablet)
**Then** the UI should adapt responsively and remain visually clear and functional

Would you like these use cases formatted into a table or exported to a document?


Absolutely! Based on your requirements and stack, here's a well-crafted **prompt/description of your app architecture**, suitable for documentation, onboarding, or technical interviews:

---

## 📐 **App Architecture Prompt: Debt Management Flutter App**

Our **Flutter-based Debt Management App** is architected using a modular, scalable, and maintainable structure to manage personal or small business debt records. The architecture emphasizes clean separation of concerns, testability, and responsiveness across devices.

---

### 🔧 **1. Tech Stack Overview**

* **Frontend Framework:** Flutter (with `flutter_bloc` for state management)
* **Backend:** Rust-based REST API (connected via Dio + Retrofit)
* **Authentication:** Firebase Auth (Email, Phone, Google)
* **Database:** Cloud Firestore (optional offline caching if needed)
* **Exporting Tools:** `pdf`, `excel`
* **Media Handling:** `image_picker`, `speech_to_text`

---

### 🧱 **2. Architectural Layers**

#### 📂 **Presentation Layer**

* **UI Components:** Built using Flutter widgets with a focus on responsive design (`responsive_framework`, `flutter_svg`)
* **State Management:** `flutter_bloc` to ensure clear separation between UI and business logic
* **Routing & Navigation:** Declarative navigation (e.g., `go_router` or `auto_route` can be considered)

#### 🧠 **Domain Layer**

* **Use Cases:** Define app-specific business logic like:

  * `AddTransactionUseCase`
  * `FetchCustomerDetailUseCase`
  * `GenerateReportUseCase`
* **Entities:** Core business models like `Customer`, `Transaction`, `DebtSummary`

#### 📊 **Data Layer**

* **Repository Pattern:** Abstract interface with concrete implementations using:

  * Firebase for auth
  * REST API (Dio + Retrofit) for CRUD operations
  * Local caching strategies if necessary
* **Data Sources:**

  * RemoteDataSource (REST API)
  * LocalDataSource (e.g., SharedPreferences or secure storage)

---

### 🔐 **3. Authentication Flow**

* Managed via `firebase_auth`
* Supports multi-provider login (Email, Phone, Google)
* Handles login, logout, and user session management
* Redirects to Dashboard on successful login

---

### 📉 **4. Data Flow**

* UI (Widget) → Bloc Event → Use Case → Repository → API/Cache → State → UI

---

### 📊 **5. Features Implemented per Architecture**

| Feature                  | Bloc | Use Case | Repository | API | Widget |
| ------------------------ | ---- | -------- | ---------- | --- | ------ |
| Dashboard Stats          | ✅    | ✅        | ✅          | ✅   | ✅      |
| Customer List + Search   | ✅    | ✅        | ✅          | ✅   | ✅      |
| Customer Detail          | ✅    | ✅        | ✅          | ✅   | ✅      |

| Image Upload             | ✅    | ✅        | ✅          | ✅   | ✅      |
| Voice Note Transcription | ✅    | ✅        | ✅          | -   | ✅      |
| Analytical Reports       | ✅    | ✅        | ✅          | ✅   | ✅      |
| Export to PDF/Excel      | ✅    | ✅        | ✅          | -   | ✅      |

---

### 💡 **Smart Features**

* **Advanced Search & Filters:** Implemented with `flutter_typeahead` and custom filter logic
* **Responsive UI:** Enabled via `responsive_framework`
* **Charts & Visuals:** Integrated using `syncfusion_flutter_charts`
* **Voice to Text:** Recorded using `speech_to_text` and transcribed to note fields

🧪 Testing Strategy
Unit Tests: Focused on BLoC, Use Cases, and Repository Logic

Widget Tests: For UI interactions and visual correctness

Mocking: API and Firebase calls can be mocked for reliable testing
